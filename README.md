# üìå Project Overview

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to derive valuable business insights using **SQL and Power BI.** The dataset consists of multiple tables containing hotel information, booking trends, customer ratings, and revenue data. The analysis focuses on **occupancy rates, revenue trends, customer behavior, and booking platform performance.**

# üéØ Objectives

#### üîπ Identify key revenue drivers for Luxury and Business hotels.

#### üîπ Analyze occupancy rates, booking trends, and seasonal impacts.

#### üîπ Evaluate booking platform performance and guest preferences.

#### üîπ Assess revenue loss due to cancellations and provide actionable recommendations.

#### üîπ Visualize findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard for strategic decision-making.

# Dataset Description

- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

- Power BI: I can use these to create a greate visual to my **SQL query result** and **final Dashboard report.**

        ) AS occupancy_rate_percentage
FROM
    fact_aggregated_bookings
    LEFT JOIN dim_hotels
    ON fact_aggregated_bookings.property_id = dim_hotels.property_id
    LEFT JOIN dim_rooms
