Insights from the Chart: "Impact of Revenue on Customer Ratings Across Hotels & Cities"

Mumbai Generates the Highest Revenue:

    -- The purple bubble (Mumbai) is positioned at the highest revenue level (~$668.64M), indicating that Mumbai hotels generate the most revenue despite an average customer rating of around 3.65.

Bangalore has Strong Revenue but Lower Ratings:

    -- The blue bubble (Bangalore) has the second-highest revenue ($420.40M) but the lowest customer rating (3.41).

Delhi Achieves the Highest Customer Rating:

    -- The blue bubble (Delhi) is positioned at the highest rating (3.78) while having a moderate revenue ($294.50M).

    -- This suggests that customers in Delhi are more satisfied with hotel services, even if revenue isnâ€™t the highest.
